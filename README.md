# iExpense
An expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs

At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent), but in order to accomplish those two things I am going to need to utilize the following:

* Present and dismiss a second screen of data.
* Delete rows from a list
* Save and load user data
